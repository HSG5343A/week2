#Problem

I want to show a list of most recent articles from the NYT on a map, according to the location of the article. When a user clicks on the map point, I want to see the article title.


1. show a map (google maps)
2. get the articles using NYT API
3. use google geocoding service to convert articles to points
4. add the points to the map
5. respond to point click event, and show article title
